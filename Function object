The key difference between the two versions of `makeCounter` is **where the `count` variable is stored**:

**First Code: Using `counter.count` (Property on Function)**
In the first code, `count` is a **property** of the `counter` function itself. 
The function `counter()` increments and returns `counter.count`. Here's how it works:

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  function counter() {
    return counter.count++; // counter.count is a property on the function object
  }

  counter.count = 0; // Initializing counter.count as a property of the function

  return counter;
}

let counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 0 (counter.count is returned, then incremented)
console.log(counter()); // 1 (counter.count is returned, then incremented)
```

 **How it works:**
- The function `counter` has a **property** `count` that is directly attached to it (`counter.count = 0`).
- Every time `counter()` is called, it increments `counter.count` and returns the old value.
- The `count` is not hidden or private. You can directly access and modify it by doing `counter.count` outside the function.

### **Second Code: Using Lexical Environment (Private Variable)**
In the second code, `count` is a **local variable** inside the `makeCounter` function. It’s not a property of the function but a **private** variable hidden within the closure. Here’s the code:

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0; // Private variable inside the lexical environment

  return function() {
    return count++; // This function has access to `count` via closure
  };
}

let counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 0 (count is returned, then incremented)
console.log(counter()); // 1 (count is returned, then incremented)
```

 **How it works:**
- `count` is a **private variable** inside the `makeCounter` function's scope.
- Each time the inner function (returned by `makeCounter`) is called, it accesses and increments this hidden `count` variable.
- You **cannot directly access or modify** `count` outside the function, because it’s not exposed like a property.


 **Key Differences:**
1. **Where `count` is stored:**
   - **First code**: `count` is a property on the `counter` function object (`counter.count`).
   - **Second code**: `count` is a private variable inside the lexical environment, inaccessible from outside.

2. **Access to `count`:**
   - **First code**: You can access and modify `counter.count` directly from outside the function.
   - **Second code**: You cannot access or modify `count` directly; it's protected by the closure.

3. **Encapsulation:**
   - **First code**: The `count` is not encapsulated; it's a property of the function.
   - **Second code**: The `count` is fully encapsulated (private) and only accessible within the function.

 Conclusion:
- The first code is more flexible, allowing external access to `count`, but it's less secure as the value can be modified from outside.
- The second code provides better encapsulation and data protection since `count` is private and only modified internally.
